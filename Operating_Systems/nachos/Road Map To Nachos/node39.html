This section discusses common problems that  students ran into over
and over again (even after having been warned about them).
<P>
<OL><LI> The VM assignment works mostly correctly, but running <em>matmult</em> in background prevents the shell from executing any more
commands, even though it prompts the user and seems to read the
command OK.
<P>
<A NAME=readmemproblem>&#160;</A>
What is happening: The pages (in user space) holding the arguments to
the system calls are being paged out before the system call routines
copy the contents of those pages into local variables.  For example,
<em>Exec</em> needs the name of the binary file to run.  Routine <em>machine::ReadMem</em> does indeed invoke <em>Translate</em> to perform
the translation, and if the target page is not present in physical
memory, generates a page fault (e.g., by invoking <em>RaiseException</em>).  <em>However</em>, <em>ReadMem</em> does <em>not</em>
retry the fetch operation; instead, it returns FALSE indicating that
the operation failed. Thus, the first byte the user attempts to fetch
will not be retrieved.  If Nachos immediately restarts the operation,
the page will now be present in memory (the probablity is very high
anyway).  If <em>ReadMem</em> is called from a loop that fetches one
character at a time, skipping the first character will likely cause
the wrong thing to happen (it is frequently NULL in practice,
terminating the string).  The same problem occurs with <em>WriteMem.</em> and can occur with any system calls that take pointers
as arguments.
<P>
One shortcut that students want to make is to simply retry the <em>ReadMem</em> operation when it fails.  That is, they assume that the
only reason <em>ReadMem</em> fails is because the target page was paged
out.  If the pointer is invalid (e.g., outside of the process's
address space), however, retrying the operation results in the same
failure.  Indeed, Nachos goes into an infinite loop at this point.
<P>
<LI> Problem: value of variables (strings in particular) changes
randomly.
<P>
What is happening: Dangling references.  Although this is a standard C
programming problem, students repeatedly forgot to allocate space for
strings.  For example, as part of the <em>Exec</em> system call, it is
useful for debugging purposes to store the name of the file with the
address space.  This requires allocating space to hold the string and
copying that file name into that newly allocated space.  In contrast,
students often simply set a pointer to the file name argument passed
to the routine that implements <em>Exec</em>.  However, when that
routine returns, the <em>Exec</em> system call completes, and the space
that held the file name gets deallocated.  Chance are good that the
next system call to be executed will reuse the same space, placing
different data in its contents.
