One thing you need to be aware of is that the MIPS architecture (like
many RISC architectures) has a number of instructions that do not take
effect right away.  Instructions that fetch values from memory, for
example, take so long to execute that another instruction (that
doesn't access memory) can be executed before the memory access
completes.  Such instructions are called delayed loads; the loaded
value doesn't become available right away. The MIPS architecture
executes one instruction during such <em>load</em> <em>delay</em> <em>slots</em>.
<P>
In many cases, the compiler can rearrange the order of instructions in
order to fill the delay slot with useful instruction.  For example, a
value could be loaded a few instructions earlier than it is actually
needed, as long as the target register was not being used.  When
tracing programs in Nachos, you should be aware that instructions used
in calling subroutines have a one-instruction delay.  That is, the PC
can be changed quickly, but the processor must go to memory to fetch
the instruction at the new address before it can actually execute it.
Thus, the code for calling the procedure <em>Exit</em> with an argument
of 0 would be done as follows:
<P>
<tt><PRE>        jal        Exit         # Jump to procedure ``Exit''
        addu        r4,0,0      # r4 &lt;= r0 + 0 (r0 always has a value of 0)</PRE></tt>
<P>
That is, the instruction that zeroes out register r4 appears <em>after</em> the ``jal'' instruction, rather than before as expected.

may encounter.
