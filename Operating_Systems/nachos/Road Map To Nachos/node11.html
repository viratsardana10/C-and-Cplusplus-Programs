The <EM>Disk</EM> object simulates the behavior of a real disk.  The
disk has only a single platter, with multiple tracks containing
individual sectors. Each track contains the same number of sectors,
and blocks are uniquely identified by their sector number.  As with a
real disk, the OS initiates operations to read or write a specific
sector, and a later interrupt indicates when the operation has
actually completed.  The Nachos disk allows only one pending operation
at a time; the OS may initiate new operations only when the device is
idle.  Note that it is the responsibility of the OS to insure that
new requests are not issued while the disk is busy servicing an
earlier request.
<P>
In order to simulate typical delays in accessing a disk, the Nachos
<EM>Disk</EM> object dynamically varies the time between the initiation
of an I/O operation and its corresponding I/O complete interrupt.  The
actual delay depends on how long it takes to move the disk head from
its previous location to the new track, as well as the rotational
delay encountered waiting for the desired block to rotate under the
read/write head.
<P>
The simulated disk contains <EM>NumTracks</EM> (32) tracks, each
containing <EM>SectorsPerTrack</EM> (32) sectors. Individual sectors
are <EM>SectorSize</EM> (128) bytes in size.  In addition, <EM>Disk</EM>
contains a ``track buffer'' cache. Immediately after seeking to a new
track, the disk starts reading sectors, placing them in the track
buffer. That way, a subsequent read request may find the data already
in the cache reducing access latency.
<P>
The <EM>Disk</EM> object supports the following operations:
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Disk(char *name, VoidFunctionPtr callWhenDone, int callArg):</STRONG>
<DD>
This constructor assumes that the simulated disk is kept in the Unix
file called <EM>name</EM>.  If the file does not already exist, Nachos
creates it and writes a ``magic number'' of 0x456789ab into the
initial four bytes.  The presence of a magic number allows Nachos to
distinguish a file containing a Nachos simulated disk from one
containing something else. Finally, Nachos insures that the rest of
the file contains NULL sectors.  All Nachos disks have the same size,
given by the formula  <IMG WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1021" SRC="img3.gif"  > .
<P>
If the file already exists, Nachos reads the first 4 bytes to verify
that they contain the expected Nachos ``magic number,'' terminating if
the check fails.  Note that by default the contents of a Nachos disk
is preserved across multiple Nachos sessions, allowing users to create
a Nachos file in one session, and read it in another. However, if the
disk contains a file system, and the file system is left in a
corrupted state by a previous Nachos session, subsequent Nachos
invocations are likely run into problems if they don't first verify
that the filesystem data structures are logically consistent.
<P>
The last two constructor arguments are used to provide an ``I/O
complete'' interrupt mechanism.  Specifically, the Nachos machine
signals the completion of a Disk operation (e.g., read or write) by
invoking the procedure <EM>callWhenDone</EM>, passing it an argument of
<EM>callArg</EM>.  As shown below, the <EM>SynchDisk</EM> object uses
this routine to wake up a thread that has been suspended while waiting
for I/O to complete.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>ReadRequest(int sectorNumber, char *data):</STRONG>
<DD> Is invoked to read
the specified sector number into the buffer <EM>data</EM>. In Nachos,
all sectors are the same size (<EM>SectorSize</EM>).
<P>
Note that this operations returns immediately, <EM>before</EM> the
transfer actually takes place.  <EM>ReadRequest</EM> schedules an
interrupt to take place sometime in the future, after a time roughly
dependent on the seek distance needed to complete the operation. Only
after the interrupt takes place is it correct to start using the data.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>WriteRequest(int sectorNumber, char *data):</STRONG>
<DD> Similar to <EM>
ReadRequest</EM>, except that it writes a single sector.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>ComputeLatency(int newSector, bool writing):</STRONG>
<DD> estimates the
latency required to access the block <EM>newSector</EM> given the
current position of the disk head. The routine is used in deciding
when to schedule an I/O complete interrupt when servicing a read or
write request.
